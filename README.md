Spelunker Filter - Manually configure which tiles do or don't get highlighted by the Spelunker Potion

*Did you ever want to stop copper ore from being highlighted? Did you ever want dirt to be highlighted?
You can't find the marble and granite biomes?
You are tired of Life Fruit and Life Crystal blocking more desired treasures with the Metal Detector?
With this clientside mod, you can!*

Using the **config**, you can manually specify the tiles and their behavior. There is also a preset containing all vanilla tiles for convenience.

As a bonus, the same filter will apply to the **Metal Detector**. You can turn it off in the config.

Some tiles cannot be properly configured as they are concidered a sub-tile. For example, you can only toggle all or no chests, but not specifically a Gold Chest. If there is demand, I can add support for certain vanilla tiles like Chests.

This mod also applies to other sources of the "spelunking" effect such as certain pets or other mods.
